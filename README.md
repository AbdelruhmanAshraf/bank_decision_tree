# 🏦 Bank Marketing Decision Tree
This project applies Decision Tree classification on the Bank Marketing Dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset contains various customer attributes, including demographics, banking history, and contact campaign details.

# 📊 Project Overview
Objective: Identify key factors influencing customer subscription decisions.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
# Steps Involved:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns
Building and evaluating a Decision Tree model
Visualizing the tree and feature importance

 # 📈 Key Findings
Customers contacted via cellular had a higher subscription rate.
Education level and job type significantly impacted subscription likelihood.
Previous campaign success strongly correlated with new subscription decisions.
